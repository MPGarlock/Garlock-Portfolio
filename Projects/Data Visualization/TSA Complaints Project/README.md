# TSA Complaints Data Visualizations

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes TSA passenger complaints data, focusing on trends, categories, and patterns in traveler-reported issues. The goal is to present key insights through **data visualizations** to highlight concerns and patterns in TSA service quality over time.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Publicly available TSA passenger complaint data.
- **Contents:** Includes categories such as security screening, customer service, lost/damaged property, and wait times.
- **Time Period:** Data spans multiple years, allowing for trend analysis.

## 📈 Visualizations Created
The following visualizations were generated to interpret the dataset effectively:

1. **Trend Analysis of TSA Complaints Over Time**
   - A line graph displaying the number of complaints per month/year to observe fluctuations and seasonal trends.

2. **Category Breakdown of Complaints**
   - A bar chart showing the most common complaint types, helping to identify major pain points for travelers.

3. **Geographic Distribution of Complaints**
   - A heatmap indicating which airports or regions have the highest volume of complaints.

4. **TSA Complaint Resolution Rate**
   - A pie chart visualizing how many complaints were resolved vs. unresolved, highlighting service efficiency.

5. **Wait Time vs. Complaints Correlation**
   - A scatterplot analyzing whether longer security wait times correlate with higher complaint volumes.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Visualization Libraries:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Data Processing:** Pandas

## 📌 Key Insights
- Complaint volume spikes during peak travel seasons (summer and holidays).
- Security screening and customer service issues are the most frequent complaints.
- Certain airports consistently receive higher complaint rates.
- Longer TSA wait times often correlate with increased complaints.
