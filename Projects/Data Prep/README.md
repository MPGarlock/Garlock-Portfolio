# 🛠️ Data Preparation Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my **Data Preparation** portfolio! 🎯 This section highlights my expertise in **data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing**, essential steps in any data science or analytics workflow. High-quality data leads to accurate insights, and I specialize in refining raw datasets into actionable formats.

## Key Skills & Techniques

I apply various **data preparation** techniques to ensure datasets are clean, structured, and optimized for analysis:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
- **Data Transformation:** Normalization, standardization, and feature engineering.
- **ETL Processes:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data for efficient analysis.
- **Automation:** Scripting data pipelines using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and SQL.
- **Big Data Processing:** Working with large datasets in Hadoop and Spark.
