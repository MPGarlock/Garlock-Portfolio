# 🗄️ SQL Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my **SQL Portfolio!** 🚀🔍 This section showcases my expertise in **database management, data querying, and business intelligence (BI)** using SQL. From retrieving insights through complex queries to optimizing database performance, I leverage SQL to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Key Skills & Techniques

I use **SQL** for a wide range of data-related tasks, including:

- **Data Extraction & Querying:** Writing optimized `SELECT`, `JOIN`, and `GROUP BY` queries to retrieve meaningful insights.
- **Database Design & Management:** Creating normalized schemas, indexing, and optimizing performance.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Cleaning and preparing data for analytics.
- **Stored Procedures & Functions:** Automating repetitive database operations.
- **Big Data Processing:** Using SQL with Hadoop, Spark, and cloud-based solutions (AWS, BigQuery).
