# Data Mining Projects

## Overview  
This section showcases various **data mining projects** that apply advanced analytical techniques to extract meaningful patterns, trends, and insights from structured and unstructured data. These projects involve **data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering, classification, association rule mining, and predictive modeling** using Python, R, and machine learning algorithms.

Each project includes **detailed documentation, code explanations, and visualizations** to demonstrate the entire data mining processâ€”from raw data collection to actionable insights.
