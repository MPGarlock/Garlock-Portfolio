Retail Sales Forecasting

Predicting Store Sales Using Time Series Models

Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting retail sales using historical transaction data from the Kaggle competition Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting. The goal is to develop predictive models that help retailers optimize inventory management, staffing, and overall business strategy.

Dataset

Source: Kaggle - Store Sales Time Series Forecasting
Files Used:
train.csv – Historical sales data by store, product family, and date.
transactions.csv – Daily transaction counts per store.
stores.csv – Store details including location, type, and cluster.
oil.csv – Daily oil prices as an external factor impacting sales.
Objective

Build a predictive model to forecast future sales using time series techniques, feature engineering, and machine learning. The project explores seasonal patterns, external influences, and model performance to improve sales predictions.

Methods & Approach

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing trends, seasonality, and outliers.
Identifying correlations between sales, transactions, and external factors.
Feature Engineering
Creating lag features, rolling averages, and holiday indicators.
Incorporating store characteristics and oil price trends.
Modeling
Baseline Models: Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing.
Machine Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.
Time Series Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM.
Evaluation
Metrics: RMSE, MAPE, Time Series Cross-Validation.
Comparing model performance across different store types.
Tools & Technologies

Python – Data processing and modeling
pandas, numpy – Data manipulation
matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly – Data visualization
scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM – Machine learning
statsmodels, Prophet – Time series analysis
Challenges & Considerations

Handling missing data and irregular time series patterns.
Managing external factors that impact sales.
Ensuring model generalizability across different stores and regions.
Next Steps

Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
Experiment with deep learning models like LSTMs.
Deploy a forecasting dashboard for real-time predictions.
